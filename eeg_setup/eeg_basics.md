# What is an EEG?

EEG (electroencephalography) is one of the neuroimaging methods. It’s characterised by incredible temporal resolution and average spatial resolution. It’s consists of a cap with 16, 32, 64 or 128 electrodes. The number of electrodes determines the spatial resolution. In our lab, we use a 64-electrode cap. 
EEG measures electrical potentials from the scalp. Because of this, we must be aware that our results may contain not only the true brain signals but also signals from the facial muscles. 
It is an amazing method for studying brain activity in real time.
